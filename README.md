ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in artificial intelligence, particularly its applications in knowledge management. As someone with ADHD, I'm passionate about exploring how AI can serve as a "second brain" to enhance productivity and information processing.
ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning about large language models like Claude, Perplexity, and ChatGPT. I'm using these AI assistants to code in Python and explore the OpenAI Assistants API platform. This builds on my earlier coding experience with QBASIC and C++ from a very long time ago.
âš¡ Fun fact: I'm Native American and deeply interested in ancient history. I'm actively researching my people's history with the goal of creating a fine-tuned AI model that combines oral histories and academic studies to build a comprehensive timeline of my people's past.
